        <div class="importance">
            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>Many technical documents, especially in programming and cybersecurity, come with dark themes. While these look great on screens, they can be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Difficult to read in bright environments</li>
                <li>Challenging to print due to high ink consumption</li>
                <li>Straining on the eyes during extended reading sessions</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="technology">
